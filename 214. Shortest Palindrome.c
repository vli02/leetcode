214. Shortest Palindrome

Given a string S, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.


For example: 
Given "aacecaaa", return "aaacecaaa".
Given "abcd", return "dcbabcd".

char* shortestPalindrome(char* s) {
    // two pointers, head and tail
    // verify if it is a valid palindrome
    // if not, reduce tail pointer and repeat verify
    // if yes, stop verify
    // add characters from end to the tail pointer to a buffer
    // append characters from head to tail to the buffer
    // done
    return s;
}
